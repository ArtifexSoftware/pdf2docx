        ''' Merge all text blocks into one text block.
            
            NOTE:            
            Lines in text block must have same property, e.g. height, vertical distance, 
            because average line height is used when create docx. However, the contained lines 
            may be not reasonable after this step. So, this is just a pre-processing step focusing 
            on processing lines in horizontal direction, e.g. merging inline image to its text line.
            A further step, e.g. split lines vertically, must be applied before final making docx.
